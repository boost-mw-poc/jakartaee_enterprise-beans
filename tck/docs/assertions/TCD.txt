TCK Coverage Document for JSR-345 Enterprise JavaBeans 3.2 Specification


TCK Components:
---------------
- User's Guide
- Compatibility Rules
- Configuration Instructions
- Test Suite
- API Tests 
- Signature Tests
- End-to-End Tests
- Framework Code
- JavaTest TM Harness


Terminology of Metrics
----------------------
- Assertion: A specific statement of functionality or behavior derived from a
  specification. A testable assertion is one that can be validated in an
  implementation by testing.
- Test: A binary application (or script) comprised of one or more Test Cases.
- Test Case: A single set of test inputs, execution conditions, and expected
  results developed to verify an implementation's conformance with a specific
  assertion.
- Specification Assertion Coverage: Ratio of all assertions tested by at least
  one test case to the total number of testable assertions defined by the
  specification.
- API Coverage: Ratio of methods directly exercised by test cases to the total
  number of methods defined by the specification.


Coverage
--------

- Total testable assertions derived from EJB 3.2 Specifications and Javadoc: 

       2946 specification assertions
     +  495 API assertions          
     -------------------------------
       3441 testable assertions     

- Total testable assertions tested

       2016 specification assertions tested
     +  340 API assertions tested          
     --------------------------------------
       2356 testable assertions tested    

  - 68.43% of testable specification assertions tested
  - 68.67% of testable API assertions tested          
  - 68.47% of all (specification and API) assertions tested

- Assertions were identified through the use of CTS Tools and hand markup
  (hand markup was required for EJB specifications, non Javadoc)

- Number of EJB tests in CTS 7: 6,607
    - Note, this total may change before CTS 7 ships.

- API Signature Coverage: 100% of EJB public and protected members are
  validated by the signature tests included with the CTS 7.


Quality Assurance
-----------------
The Enterprise JavaBeans requirements were tested as part of the JavaEE 7
Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) which was run using representative configurations
of the JavaEE Reference Implementation on the following platforms using
JavaSE 7:

   * Ubuntu 12.10
   * Fedora 18
   * openSUSE 12.2
   * Solaris 11.1 Sparc
   * Solaris 11.1 X86
   * Solaris 10 Sparc
   * MacOS 10.8
   * Oracle Linux Server release 6.4
   * Windows XP Professional
   * Windows 2008

- CTS was run with the following databases:
   * Oracle 11.2
   * MySQL 5.6
   * Postgres 9.2
   * DB2 10.1
   * Microsoft SQL Server 2012
   * Sybase ASE 15.7

* Note, not all permutations of platforms and DBs were tested.
   
- Code quality was demonstrated through the use of code reviews and inspections
- User's Guide was constructed from the standard CTS User's Guide template
- Documentation instructions were verified and tested


Justification of Adequacy
-------------------------
The Enterprise JavaBeans tests, distributed as part of JavaEE CTS version 7,
provide an adequate set of tests to ensure all implementations of the JavaEE 7
Platform are compatible with the requirements defined in the EJB specifications.  
Note, while the CTS may not have tests for all assertions defined in the EJB
specifications, all implementations of the platform must be compatible with the
EJB specifications.

Untested assertions are due to the effects of late specification changes, and
the availability and cost of test development resources.
